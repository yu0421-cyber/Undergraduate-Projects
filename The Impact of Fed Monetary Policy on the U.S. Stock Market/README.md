a project from **Topics on International Trade and Finance**

**Project Overview**: This project examines the relationship between the U.S. monetary policy (Federal Funds Rate) and the stock market performance in the U.S. from 1990 to 2024.

**Methodology**: We utilized Vector Autoregression (VAR) and Impulse Response Functions (IRF) to analyze four major recession periods.

**Case Studies**: the Gulf War, the dot-com bubble, the 2008 financial crisis, and the Covid-19 pandemic

**Variables**: monthly data of Industrial Production Index(IP), Consumer Price Index(CPI), Federal Funds Rate(FFR), Unexpected One-Year Interest Rate(Unexp R), and the S&P 500 Index

**Conclusion**: The relationship between monetary policy and the stock market is not always static, therefore we should consider different economic backgrounds and market sentiments in accordance with economic policies.

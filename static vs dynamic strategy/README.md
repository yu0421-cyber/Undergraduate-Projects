# Static vs. Dynamic Trading Strategy
a project for **Introduction to Imformation Engineering**

**Trading Rules**
1. Sliding 5-period K-line Window: Each signal is generated by a window consisting of the most recent 5 trading days (the current day plus the preceding 4 days).
2. Single Position Constraint: Once a trade is entered, no further entries can be made until the current position is closed. One stock may only hold one position at a time to ensure the comparability of trades.
3. Reinvestment Policy: The capital for the next trade is the principal of the previous trade plus its realized profit or loss (Total Reinvestment).
4. No Same-Day Entry/Exit: Since yfinance data only provides daily Open/Close bars, to ensure practical execution, the exit price must occur at least one day after the entry price.

**Trading Cost**
1. Capital Allocation: One position per stock with a capital of $2M USD per stock. Across 15 stocks, the total capital is $30M USD.
2. Transaction Fees: Entry and exit fees are $10.99 USD each. The total transaction cost for one complete trade is $21.98 USD.
3. Regulatory Fees: SEC fees and TAF fees should be included. However, due to the large capital scale, their impact is negligible and thus omitted from calculations.

**Entry Standards Design**
1. Entry Standards: The upper shadow must account for at least 20% of the total K-line body. The lower shadow must account for at least 30% of the total K-line body.

**Exit Standards Design**
1. Hit Take-Profit/Stop-Loss Levels: Exit immediately when the price reaches the preset Take-Profit (10%) or Stop-Loss (3.33%) targets.
2. Profit Retracement (Trailing Stop): If the position is profitable but the price retraces more than 25% from its peak, the position is closed early to prevent profit evaporation, even if the primary Take-Profit target hasn't been hit.
